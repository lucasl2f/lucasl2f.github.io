**Crafting Back Home** is a small time-travel crafting game where you explore, collect materials, and combine them until you build the final piece.

## About the project

This is my second game made in Godot. After a busy month learning the engine's basics on my previous project, I felt prepared to tackle something bigger. This time, the timebox was three months.

Crafting Back Home actually started as a clicker game, but I was really curious to experiment with a 3D character controller in Godot. So, the clicker mechanics were scrapped in favor of resource crafting and opening portals. I also couldn't put my passion for time travel aside, so the plot is built entirely around that.

There’s still a massive pile of potential improvements sitting on my GitHub, but the game is done. Let's move to the next one.

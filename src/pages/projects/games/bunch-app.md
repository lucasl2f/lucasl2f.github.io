## About the project

Working on the Bunch app was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into multiplayer development. Built on Unity and Quantum, the app required an extensive list of real-time features, which taught me how to properly design and implement synced events across devices.

Over the course of three years, I was part of the team that developed several mini-games, over 10 public hangout spaces, various home environments (including a decorating system), and full character customization.

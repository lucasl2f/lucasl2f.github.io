**Rocket Lander** is a skill-based landing challenge where you pilot a rocket through stylized terrains, balancing thruster and gravity to achieve the perfect touchdown.

## About the project

This was my very first project in Godot. I was looking for an excuse to finally dive into the engine, and this was it.

Rocket Lander was built in just one month as part of a challenge with a friend: we formed a collective to take turns releasing a game every few months.
The one-month timebox was intense, but I'm honestly pretty satisfied with the result. The list of things I could improve is huge, but I’m deciding to save those lessons for my next projects instead.

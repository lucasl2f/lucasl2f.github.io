**Grand Shooter** is the reinvention of the Light Gun On-Rails Shooter genre, from old school arcades to modern devices.
You take control of Joan, an ex-military who is dragged to a much more personal war when Elliot, Joan’s girlfriend, is kidnapped by a mysterious enemy force. She must chase the culprits through a paradisiac island and save her girlfriend.

## About the project

Grand Shooter was my first professional experience. I joined Grumpy Panda in 2015 with an open mind, eager to soak up everything I could.

Working in a small studio meant constantly switching hats to build whatever was needed at the moment: a new 3D model, a controller class, a Unity tool, a promo video, or sound FX. I can't overstate how much that environment expanded my toolset and shaped me as a developer.

Grand Shooter was a true game-changer for my career, and I'm incredibly proud to have been part of a project downloaded more than 1.1 million times.

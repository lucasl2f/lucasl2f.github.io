**Grand Shooter** is the reinvention of the Light Gun On-Rails Shooter genre, from old school arcades to modern devices.
You take control of Joan, an ex-military who is dragged to a much more personal war when Elliot, Joan’s girlfriend, is kidnapped by a mysterious enemy force. She must chase the culprits through a paradisiac island and save her girlfriend.

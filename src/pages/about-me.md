I'm a game developer who took the scenic route. I started coding in the beloved days of Flash and AS3, eventually spending years building professional projects in Unity (most recently for the Bunch app).

My background is actually in Cinema. I went to college dreaming of film editing and special FX, but interactive media caught my attention and I’ve been making games ever since. My proudest early achievement was Grand Shooter, a project that taught me C# and found its way onto 1.1 million devices.

In July 2025, I took the leap to go solo. I’ve been deep-diving into Godot, releasing two games and planning the next one. Off-screen, I’ve been practicing parkour for over 20 years. I also love board games, movies, playing drums and a great cup of coffee.
